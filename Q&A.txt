1. variable scope in loop
var i = 0,
	j = 0,
	array = [];

for (i=0; i++; i<10) {
	array.push(function() {
		console.log(i);
	});
}

for (i=0; i++; i<10) {
	array[i]();
}

//Output?


var i = 0,
	j = 0,
	array = [];

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
	array.push(function() {
		console.log(i);
	});
}

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
	array[i]();
}

//Output

20. Store cached of results for second time

function memoize(fun) {
	var result = null;
	return (arg) => {
		if(!result) {
			result = func(arg);
		}
		return result;
	}
}

function add(a) {
	return a + 1;
}

var memFun = memoize(add);

memFun(1) // Calculate
memFun(2) // not calculate again


// Find different things in 2 objects (a with different values and property difference b and c)
diff(obj1, obj2) {

}

var obj1 = {
	a: 3,
	b: 1
};

var obj2 = {
	a: 2,
	c: 2
};

diff(obj1, obj2);

1. What is the different between Router vs Route in react-router-dom?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43949554/what-is-the-different-between-router-vs-route-in-react-router-dom
Router
Router component is what makes the connection between browser location and the react application. It doesn't render anything visible on your page. It just exposes API to interact with location changes of the browser via React context. So any component down the tree can use this API to change their behavior based on location changes in the browser or change the browser location into what they want.
Router is the abstract for all other specific router components. Practically, we use a specific implementation of it like BrowserRouter, MemoryRouter, and HashRouter which use different methods to manage browser history. Also, Router is usually a top-level component in the component tree and use only one time in the entire application. All other react-router components should be descendants of Router as they can't function without the API which Router provides.

Route
Route is much simple to explain. It just renders some UI when a location matches the route’s path. So an application can have many Routes based on its layout complexity in different levels of the component tree. Also, Route has some additional props to configure how the match should happen. Route internally use API provided by Router to access the location and decide whether to render the given component or not.

2. React context?

3. Recompose middleware

A React utility belt for function components and higher-order components.


4. Explain mapStateToProps
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
    return {
        counter : state.counter,
        someComponentValue : state.things[ownProps.someIdProp]
    };
}

5. Explain mapDispatchToProps


6. Using Object Destructuring and Property Shorthand
export const FinancialInformation = connect(
  (
    {
      getConfigurationsAPIResponse: {
        configurations: { minIncome } // Get 'minIncome' only from object 'configurations'
      },
      form: { customerFinancialInformation: { values } = { values: {} } },
      getLOVAPIResponse: {
        data: { loanPurpose = [] }
      }
    },
    ownProps
  ) => ({})
)

7. Define a function with inner functions ES6
Declaration:
const minRequired = minValue => errorMessage => value =>
  value >= minValue ? undefined : `${errorMessage} Rp${minValue}`;

Execution:
// minRequired(minValue)(errorMessage)(value); 
minRequired(4)('less than default')(2);


CBA’s interview questions for FE Dev
1.	Introduce yourself
2.	What do you know about ReactJS?
a library, a web with many components. Reacts split your web into components (as V in MVC)
3.	What are different between Angular and ReactJS?
Angular: framework with routing, state management, native HTML
ReactJS: a library, support component for represent pages only, external redux for state, JSX instead HTML
4.	Tell about Lifecycle of React component.
Each component has a life cycle
componentWillMount Immediately before initial rendering
componentDidMount Immediately after initial rendering
componentWillReceiveProps when component receives new props
shouldComponentUpdate (return true|false) before rendering, after receiving new props or state
componentWillUpdate (not return false, but há some parameters) Before redering, after receiving new props or state
componentWillUnmount before removing component from DOM (destroy)
5.	Is DOM in ReacJs different DOM HTML?
6.	How DOM is rendered in page?
difference in virtual dom and real dom -> update to html dom
7.	How to make responsive image that does not use CSS?
<img width="100%"
8.	Bubbling in JavaScript
event go from lowest element to its parents, it will fire event from lowest first, then parent if have
Capturing: from top to the lowest
9.	Rem and Em  in CSS
rem relative to root <html> element (default 16px)
em relative to parent element
10.	Do you know Waterfall methodology?
Sequential design, one phase finish, then another phase: plan, build, test, ...
11.	Tell about Scrum methodology
small features in process (plan, build, ...), repeat and repeat again ...
12.	Describe Scrum process
PO (provide backlog)

--save-dev is used to save the package for development purpose. Example: unit tests, minification..
--save is used to save the package required for the application to run.

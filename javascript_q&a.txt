1. Difference between localStorage/sessionStorage/cookie?

Cookie: data sent to serve in each request (<4KB), expiration is set in client or server
2. Difference between setTimeout/setInterval? miliseconds
setTimeout: run once
setInterval: run always in time
3. Eventloop in JS
The event loop on every iteration looks if there's smth in the call stack, and executes it.
4. Explain the working mechanism of setTimeout?
JavaScript is a single-threaded scripting language, so it can execute one piece of code at a time (due to its single-threaded nature) each of 
these blocks of code is “blocking” the progress of other asynchronous events.
This means that when an asynchronous event occurs (like a mouse click, a timer firing, or an XMLHttpRequest completing) it gets queued up to be executed later.

setTimeout() when you use setTimeout() it will execute only when its turn comes in a queue,
if an earlier event (of setTimeout) blocks due to some reason setTimeout can be delayed than the specified time in setTimeout() function. 
during the execution of setTimeout callback function, if any event occurs(e.g click event),it gets queued up to be executed later.

10. How many way do we use to declare function in JS?
https://dmitripavlutin.com/6-ways-to-declare-javascript-functions/
+function declaration
function calcRectArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}
+function expression
var getRectArea = function(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}
+Shorthand method definition
var foo = {
    a: function() {},
    b: function() {}
};
+Arrow function
+Generator function
function* generator(i) {
  yield i;
  yield i + 10;
}
console.log(gen.next().value);
// expected output: 10
console.log(gen.next().value);
// expected output: 20
+Function constructor
var sum = new Function('a', 'b', 'return a + b');

12. Diff between window & document in JS?
Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model.
You can access it as window in most of the cases (in the browser);

window.screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

window.document or just document is the main object of the visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.

The window is the actual global object.

The screen is the screen, it contains properties about the user's display.

The document is where the DOM is.

    }
}

/* Set the background color of body to tan */
body {
  background-color: tan;
}

/* On screens that are 992px or less, set the background color to blue */
@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}

/* On screens that are 600px or less, set the background color to olive */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: olive;
  }
}
